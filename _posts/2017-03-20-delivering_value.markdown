I had a long conversation recently with a product manager. His development team had been working for a bit of time on a plan to implement a piece of content creation software and a delivery method for the content created. The team was really excited because they felt confident that they were going to build a really great suite of tools that would be far better than what was currently in place.

Development is tough. You have to solve the technical challenges of how to build something flexible, secure, reliable, and performant. There are endless decisions that need to be made and managing time and expectations while doing that is no small feat.

Business is tough. You have to know what differentiates you in the market and where you can afford to do something "well enough" and where you must be better than everyone else.

As a developer, you tend to want to deliver great software. Regardless of whether you're working for a company that sells software or develops their own software to achieve internal goals and deliver their core business, you want to do a good job. But sometimes it is easy to get wrapped up in writing great software for the sake of writing great software. This product manager's team had lost sight of the fact that their value proposition didn't lie in the delivery of content, but in its creation. In fact, it became clear that the greater value was in being able to deliver content in a way that could be utilized in multiple scenarios, rather than just one. 

The team needed to ceed a little control and actually deliver LESS in order to deliver more value.

This was an interesting lesson for me because it really hit home that building something appropriate is almost always preferable to building something perfect and that the most important question to be asking yourself is "Where's the sweet spot?"
