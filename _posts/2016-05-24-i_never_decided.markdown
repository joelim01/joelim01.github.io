...to start learning to code. It just sort of happened. 

As a kid I learned the DOS command line to run our family computer, learned logo in school, and tinkered with qbasic exploding bananas. 

I stuck with computers but was on a long hiatus from code until I took a class in C++ in high school and I'll admit that I struggled with it a bit. I needed the help of my classmates to understand what the exercises and readings were supposedly making clear to us, but I was amazed by what code could do and I decided to keep at it. So much so that I thought I'd major in Computer and Electrical Engineering. 

Well, it turns out that things don't always go as you plan. My intro level course in Scheme felt a lot like a repeat of my experience with C++ but this time without the helpful classmates. I struggled to make the code run, to "get it," but in the end I dropped the class. I thought, since it seemed that others could do it and I couldn't, that coding just wasn't for me.

It wasn't all bad. Around that time I fell in love with Architecture and design. Later I started to pick up scripting geometry, then building sketches in Processing, and finally poking around in HTML, CSS, JS and Angular. But I was just dabbling. I was constantly feeling like I should do more, spend more time working with code, more time improving. 

So this time, with a little more experience under my belt and a deeper understanding of learning and teaching styles, I've decided that it is time to stop feeling like I should do something and just go do it. Not because I've had any epiphany but because I have always loved code and I will no longer listen to that little voice telling me "I'm not a coder."
