Experiences.

This week I met with a few more people to talk about their experiences as they started to code professionally. 

As you might expect, many of their stories are personal and the plots impossible to duplicate: Taking a job in a small company in order to take on development duties above and beyond the role applied for. Leaving a profession to return to grad school where a summer internship becomes a full time job. Taking a class, offered just once *ever*, with a professor who just happened to work at their dream employer.

There is no silver bullet or guaranteed method. As you might expect, I've heard many stories about opportunities coming on their own time. It is impossible to rush any of it. 

The one constant in all of it is persistence. Keep coding. Keep talking to people. Keep looking. Keep putting yourself out there. Keep believing there is something that is right for you. You're going to get knocked down, probably more than once. Just like the challenge of learning to code. You've done this before.
 
So, hang in there. Learn from every experience. Be just a little bit better every time.

And remember, none of these stories took place locked in a room behind a computer. Talking to people can be hard. Talking to people and telling them *"I'm a web developer."* probably feels strange if you've never held the job.  Do it. This is what you've been working towards. There is no magic moment when you will suddenly feel ready and prepared. This feeling of always having more to learn is what you've signed up for. Every damn day. Be excited. Embrace it.
