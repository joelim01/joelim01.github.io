Guess how many of those I knew this morning? 

0. Nil. Zilch.

I worked on a code challenge today for several technologies that I had no exposure to. I was told that the code challenge should take approximately 4 hours. I spent 8 and then stopped, maybe halfway through. My interviewer and presumably my technical contact knew that I'd never worked with any of them. 

I learned a lot but I am exhausted. I didn't even get to Docker.

I have to go back to another code challenge on PHP and Angular tomorrow. I have until Tuesday for that one. Guess how much PHP I knew when I started that? 

I feel like code challenges are my new bootcamp.
