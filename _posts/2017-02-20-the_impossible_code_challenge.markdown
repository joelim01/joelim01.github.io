title:  "The (Impossible?) Code Challenge"

I received a code challenge this week which required the creation of a script that would download data from a website, organize it into a JSON file, and save that file. This all sounds pretty straightforward, right? Well, I quickly discovered that the site did not have a public API and that the site was unscrapable--results were a captcha or 405 error, depending on method--and the support team confirmed this.

So, I asked myself... could it be that the code challenge is simply designed to determine who will follow up and ask questions and who will not? The prompt included the line "Make any assumptions you need to." It did not include any instructions about questions.

So, did I send a message asking for clarification?

Well...

Assumptions seem rarely necessary and rarely a good idea when designing and developing software. Clear requirements make everything go much more smoothly. The code challenge was pretty vague, and I imagine that it was designed to be so.

And yet I still made an assumption.

I assumed that the code challenge was meant to gauge ability/knowledge and was not meant to be a behavioral test. Was this a good assumption? Jury's out.

But, if that assumption was correct (and I feel, right or wrong, it was supported by the email and code challenge itself) then the important thing was the code. Useful code, in this case, was not determined by the usefulness of the software but by its ability to enable the assessor to judge my problem solving and coding ability and style. 

So I went ahead and created a script that could (were it allowed) fulfill the requirements of the challenge by scraping the site.

This isn't the sort of assumption I'd make when the purpose of my coding is to produce a product. And I may learn that this is one of the many cases when making an assumption is in fact, the wrong choice. 

But I hope to hear back either way. I think it will be a good learning experience.
